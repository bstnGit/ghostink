Hello,

1. `git pull` to pull the latest version from the **develop** branch.
2. Make the necessary changes in the code.
3. `git checkout -b user/<yournameshort>/<ticket-id>` to bring those changes to your own branch.
4. `git add` to add the changes.
5. `git commit -m "Knowledgebase: <description of your changes here>"` to add the commit to your own branch.
6. Create a pull/merge request (PR) with the same title as the commit for example: **"Knowledgebase: Added how to contribute to knowledgebase"**. 
	1. **Important!** Make sure the PR is merging your branch into the -> **develop** branch
	2. Always add another developer as a reviewer
	3. Assign yourself to the PR
	4. If needed add necessary labels
	5. If you want you can describe all the changes in a comment
	6. Wait for someone to review and accept your PR
8. Close/merge your PR if not already done by the reviewer

Congrats, you have now contributed to the knowledgebase inside of the repository!
