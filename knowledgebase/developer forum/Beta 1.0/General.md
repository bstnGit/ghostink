Website

Our platform with the domain “ghostink.<domain>” comprises two distinct user pathways, the first being the Customer interface. Here, users have the capability to establish an account, place orders, or seamlessly execute both actions simultaneously. An order encompasses all necessary specifications and, in its initial stage, functions as a price inquiry. Upon order placement, should the user opt to create an account, a verification email is promptly dispatched to the user's designated email address. A Ghost, equipped with a systematic list view containing comprehensive information, reviews the order. Following a thorough assessment, once a price is determined, an email notification is transmitted to the customer. Simultaneously, the order view is updated to showcase the finalized pricing details. Subsequently, the customer has the choice to accept the offer, accompanied by a nominal n% fee to ensure the trustworthiness of the order. All communication unfolds seamlessly through email and the website interface, ensuring regular updates, regarding the order state, are provided to the customer. Upon successful completion of the order, the customer receives a notification via email, signifying the fulfillment of the requested services. This correspondence is accompanied by a demonstration of the completed work. Subsequently, upon the customer's satisfaction, the final payment is processed and the platform recives its n% cut, ending in the delivery of the finalized work. After the transaction is completed they can write a review and rate the service from n - m. Afterwards the Ghost recives his payment. This streamlined and transparent process aims to enhance user experience and improve trust throughout the transaction.
